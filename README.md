# Porbol

You are a ^ object in 3d. You move forwards in the level, with a wave trail behind you. The levels come in waves, with obstacles that you must move left or right to dodge. Some obstacles will be boxes that are upgrades. The upgrades can be either an extra life, or an offensive attack. The attacks will be projectiles that shoot towards the enemies automatically. You must continue upgrading or the enemies will reach you before you die. So there is a player wave, level wave, and enemy waves.
